However, if we look closer at this data we notice that the dramatic height increases have largely slowed down and even reversed since the 1970's and 80's. For example, take the ranges 1978-1988 and 2003-2013. Although we see a clear upwards slope for the former data, the latter actually shows a decrease in average height. This could mean that the NBA is drafting players based on different factors, or that more players are able to be successful through athleticism rather than genetic advantage. Either way, in recent years we have seen many successful NBA players in the low to mid height range, which we see reflected in salaries.,
