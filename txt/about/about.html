			<h3> About this project </h3>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				One of the most important physical aspects of any professional basketball player is their height. No matter how skilled they are at the game, falling in certain height ranges definitely gives players certain advantages or disadvantages. This project aims to examine relationships between players' heights and different aspects of their basketball careers over time. We do this through three interactive tools: a geight vs. time tool that shows height trends among players from 1978-2016, and two additional interactive graphs exploring the relationships between players' heights, game statistics, and salary. Each of these tools shows the unique height-related patterns found in the NBA.

				Our project draws on data from <a href="https://data.world/jgrosz99/nba-player-data-1978-2016"> this</a> NBA statistics dataset compiled by data.world user <a href="https://data.world/jgrosz99"> jgrosz99</a>, which includes information on players from 1978-2016. Since the NBA reorganized many of its teams in 2004, our Height vs. Salary tool that looks at individual teams only focuses on the 2004-2016 time period. The other two tools look at the entire range of years given by the dataset.<br><br>
