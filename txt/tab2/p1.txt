This data shows us a number of trends relating to height versus game statistics. Although overall efficiency does not seem to have any correlation with height, rebound percentages are skewed towards taller players and average blocks per game are heavily skewed towards the tallest players in the league (seven feet plus). On the other hand, we see much higher average steals per game among short players than their taller counterparts. Interestingly enough, we see the highest turnovers among the shortest and tallest players, with the mid-high high range seeing a dip in the data.
