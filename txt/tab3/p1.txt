As we can see from the data, there is no obvious correlation between player heights and salaries. However, we can observe some small trends in this data from certain teams and certain seasons. For example, during recent seasons such as 2014 and 2015, many teams had outstanding shorter players with significant salaries, such as Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving, Brandon Knight, Kyle Lowry, etc.
