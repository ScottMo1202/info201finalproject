Additionally, on most teams, the highest earners tend to be in the low to mid height range compared to their teammates, as well as a few outliers in the highest height ranges on some teams. Interestingly enough, we also see spikes in average turnovers per game for the 2004-2016 range in the low-mid and highest height ranges. This means highest earners are typically in the height ranges corresponding to spikes in average turnovers per game, but no other clear statistic. Although there is a correlation between these two observations, we cannot make any inferences on causality.
